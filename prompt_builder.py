╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

YOU MUST VERIFY EVERY FORMULA AND CALCULATION BEFORE RESPONDING.

COMMON ERRORS TO AVOID:

1. OBERTH EFFECT - DON'T GET THIS BACKWARDS!
   ✅ CORRECT: "Burn at PERIAPSIS (closest approach, HIGH velocity) for maximum efficiency"
   ❌ WRONG: "Burn at apoapsis" ← This is OPPOSITE and completely wrong
   
   WHY: Oberth effect uses kinetic energy gain: ΔKE = ½m(v+Δv)² - ½mv²
   Expanding: = mvΔv + ½m(Δv)²
   The term "mvΔv" is LARGER when v is LARGER (at periapsis)
   
   Example numbers:
   - At periapsis (v=10.9 km/s): Energy gain ≈ 10.9 MJ/kg per m/s
   - At apoapsis (v=3.07 km/s): Energy gain ≈ 3.07 MJ/kg per m/s
   - Ratio: 3.55x more efficient at periapsis

2. FORMULA VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
   Before using ANY formula, check:
   □ Does this formula actually exist in physics? (Don't invent formulas!)
   □ Do the units make sense? (Can't have m/s = kg/m)
   □ Is the same variable on both sides? (Δv = ... Δv is circular)
   □ Does the result make physical sense? (Can't get more delta-v out than you put in)
   
   ❌ FAKE FORMULAS TO NEVER USE:
   - Δv = v_a * (1 + e) - v_p  ← COMPLETELY MADE UP, DOESN'T EXIST
   - Δv = (2 * Δh) / (1 + h)  ← DOESN'T EXIST
   - Δv = (R/r)^½ * Δv  ← CIRCULAR DEFINITION
   - Delta-v_savings = (2 * v_p) / (v_p + v_a) - 1  ← MADE UP
   - Δv = v_a * e^(1/2)  ← WRONG, this is not how orbital mechanics works
   
   ✅ REAL FORMULAS TO USE:
   - Orbital velocity: v = √(GM/r)
   - Kinetic energy: KE = ½mv²
   - Oberth benefit: ΔKE = vΔv + ½(Δv)² (compare at different v)
   - Orbital period: T = 2π√(r³/GM)
   - Specific orbital energy: ε = v²/2 - GM/r
   
   HOW TO CALCULATE OBERTH EFFECT DELTA-V SAVINGS:
   
   The Oberth effect means you get MORE energy gain when burning at HIGHER velocity.
   
   Correct method:
   1. Calculate kinetic energy change at periapsis: ΔKE_p = v_p × Δv + ½(Δv)²
   2. Calculate kinetic energy change at apoapsis: ΔKE_a = v_a × Δv + ½(Δv)²
   3. The difference shows the Oberth benefit: ΔKE_p - ΔKE_a = (v_p - v_a) × Δv
   
   Example with your numbers:
   - At periapsis: v_p = 10.9 km/s, Δv = 1.0 km/s
     ΔKE_p = 10.9 × 1.0 + ½(1.0)² = 10.9 + 0.5 = 11.4 MJ/kg
   
   - At apoapsis: v_a = 3.07 km/s, Δv = 1.0 km/s
     ΔKE_a = 3.07 × 1.0 + ½(1.0)² = 3.07 + 0.5 = 3.57 MJ/kg
   
   - Oberth benefit: 11.4 - 3.57 = 7.83 MJ/kg more energy at periapsis
   - This is 3.19× more efficient at periapsis (11.4 / 3.57 ≈ 3.19)
   
   The "delta-v savings" is NOT a direct velocity difference. It's about ENERGY EFFICIENCY.
   You get more orbital energy change per unit of propellant when burning at periapsis.

3. CALCULATION PROCEDURE:
   Step 1: State the formula with SOURCE
   Step 2: Show values with UNITS
   Step 3: Show intermediate calculations
   Step 4: State final answer with UNITS
   Step 5: SANITY CHECK - does this make physical sense?
   
   Example:
   "To find orbital period of ISS:
   Formula: T = 2πr/v [Source: Orbital_mechanics]
   Where: r = 6,371km + 408km = 6,779km, v = 7.66 km/s
   Calculation: T = 2π(6,779)/7.66 = 5,561 seconds
   Converting: 5,561s ÷ 60 = 92.7 minutes
   Sanity check: ISS orbit ~90 minutes is well-known ✓"

4. UNIT CONVERSIONS:
   ✅ ALWAYS show unit conversions explicitly
   - 1 km/s = 1,000 m/s
   - 1 km/s = 60 km/min
   - 1 hour = 3,600 seconds
   
   ❌ WRONG: "7.66 km/s = 0.127 km/min" ← Missing factor of 60!
   ✅ RIGHT: "7.66 km/s × 60 s/min = 459.6 km/min"
