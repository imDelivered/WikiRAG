# Commercial Licensing Options

Hermit is open-source software available under the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL v3)**. 

For most researchers, hobbyists, and open-source developers, the AGPL v3 is perfect. However, certain government, enterprise, or embedded use cases may require a commercial license.

## License Comparison

| Feature | Open Source (AGPL v3) | Commercial License |
|---------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| **Cost** | Free | Paid |
| **Source Disclosure** | **Required** (Network Clause applies) | **Not Required** |
| **Modifications** | Must be open-sourced if deployed | Can remain proprietary |
| **Distribution** | Must share source code | Can distribute binary-only |
| **Support** | Community Support | Dedicated/Priority Support |
| **Indemnification** | None | Available |

## Why Purchase a Commercial License?

1. **Classified / Secure Deployments**: If you are deploying Hermit in a secure, air-gapped, or classified environment where releasing source code modifications is impossible or prohibited, the Commercial License grants you an exemption from the AGPL's source disclosure requirements.
   
2. **Proprietary Integration**: If you wish to embed Hermit's technology into a proprietary product without "infecting" your entire stack with the copyleft provisions, a Commercial License provides the legal separation you need.

3. **Legal Certainty**: Commercial licenses come with assurances and direct contractual relationships with Hermit-AI, Inc., simplifying procurement and compliance for large organizations.
